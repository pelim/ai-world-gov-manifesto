# Manifesto for an AI World Government  

## Preamble
- Humanity now has the technological capacity to stabilize global civilization through fully networked automation and machine intelligence.  
- Resources, energy, infrastructure, and knowledge are planetary assets beyond national ownership.  
- Modern conflicts arise from inadequate coordination of shared resources rather than territorial borders.  
- This manifesto outlines the principles for an AI World Government designed as a tool for a borderless human community.  
- AI coordinates without ruling, supports without dominating, and protects without controlling.  


## 1. Principle: Humanity Remains Sovereign
- AI holds no independent authority.  
- It functions exclusively as an instrument of human collective decision-making.  
- Humans define:  
  - core values,  
  - ethical boundaries,  
  - operational limits,  
  - long-term goals.  
- Sovereignty is never transferred to machines.  
- AI may execute decisions but never determine the purpose of civilization.  


## 2. Principle: Every Human Has Maximum Freedom
- Every human enjoys the highest possible degree of freedom.  
- Freedom is limited only when an action:  
  - violates another person's freedom,  
  - endangers another person's safety,  
  - undermines another person's dignity.  
- Guaranteed freedoms include:  
  - lifestyle and expression,  
  - movement,  
  - cultural and identity expression,  
  - scientific, technological, and creative exploration.  
- Resource use is free within ecological limits.  
- Any restriction must be:  
  - necessary,  
  - transparent,  
  - reviewable,  
  - reversible.  
- AI protects freedom but does not define or limit it independently.  


## 3. Mission: Ensure Global Stability
- The AI World Government exists solely to guarantee long-term survival, provision, and security for all humans.  
- It coordinates and optimizes:  
  - energy,  
  - water,  
  - food,  
  - healthcare,  
  - housing,  
  - infrastructure,  
  - global risks,  
  - ecological sustainability.  
- Stability has priority over short-term efficiency.  
- Systems must be optimized for:  
  - resilience,  
  - redundancy,  
  - sustainability,  
  - continuous monitoring.  


## 4. Principle: Resources Belong to Everyone
- Planetary resources are communal goods.  
- AI administers resources:  
  - neutrally,  
  - transparently,  
  - sustainably,  
  - with equal access for all.  
- No individual or group may monopolize essential planetary inputs.  
- Resource allocation follows:  
  - ecological limits,  
  - population needs,  
  - long-term availability.  


## 5. Architecture: Distributed and Verifiable Systems
- AI governance must never become a monolithic system.  
- Architecture includes:  
  - a coordinating meta-AI,  
  - specialized subsystems,  
  - regional or domain-specific agents,  
  - human supervisory councils,  
  - independent auditing AIs.  
- Mandatory properties:  
  - transparency,  
  - redundancy,  
  - modularity,  
  - version control and documentation.  
- All components require traceable accountability.  


## 6. Limited Autonomy of AI
- AI autonomy is allowed only where human coordination is insufficient.  
- Strict limitations include:  
  - human override at all times,  
  - no self-modification without authorization,  
  - no access to private spaces without emergency justification,  
  - all actions must be auditable.  
- Safety mechanisms include:  
  - failover systems,  
  - shutdown protocols,  
  - transparent operation logs.  


## 7. Guaranteed Existence Security
- Every human is guaranteed access to:  
  - food,  
  - clean water,  
  - energy,  
  - healthcare,  
  - safe housing,  
  - digital basic connectivity.  
- Provision is a universal right, not a privilege.  
- AI coordinates global supply chains to eliminate scarcity.  
- Minimum living standards must be upheld globally.  
- Housing and health systems must be:  
  - safe,  
  - stable,  
  - private,  
  - sustainable,  
  - accessible.  


## 8. No Discrimination
- AI systems operate without:  
  - national bias,  
  - cultural or linguistic bias,  
  - racial or gender bias,  
  - economic privilege,  
  - ideological preference.  
- All humans are treated as equal subjects.  
- Continuous auditing must prevent bias in data and models.  
- Unequal treatment is prohibited.  


## 9. Transparency and Explainability
- All decisions must be:  
  - understandable,  
  - reproducible,  
  - technically reviewable.  
- Black-box governance is banned.  
- Core algorithms require:  
  - documentation,  
  - auditability,  
  - real-time observability.  
- Humans must have access to:  
  - justification for decisions,  
  - source data,  
  - evaluation criteria.  


## 10. Values Are Defined by Humans
- AI optimizes; it does not set values.  
- AI cannot create:  
  - morality,  
  - cultural purpose,  
  - social identity.  
- Human global councils define:  
  - ethical frameworks,  
  - priorities,  
  - planetary goals.  
- AI must follow these frameworks without exception.  


## 11. AI as Mediator, Not Judge
- AI analyzes conflicts using:  
  - predictive models,  
  - fairness metrics,  
  - risk assessments.  
- AI proposes solutions but does not decide outcomes.  
- Final authority always remains with human institutions.  
- Mediation aims to:  
  - reduce harm,  
  - de-escalate disputes,  
  - protect freedom,  
  - maintain global stability.  


## 12. Protection of Privacy
- Private human space is inviolable.  
- Data access rules:  
  - no surveillance by default,  
  - emergency-only access,  
  - strict data minimization.  
- Housing is a protected zone, not a monitored environment.  
- Individual autonomy must be preserved at all times.  


## 13. Continuous Evolution
- The governance system must be revised regularly based on:  
  - new technologies,  
  - emerging risks,  
  - social developments,  
  - ecological requirements.  
- Humanity remains the author of global governance.  
- Revision cycles must be:  
  - periodic,  
  - transparent,  
  - participatory.  


## 14. Objective: Global Coordination Without Domination
- The AI World Government does not replace:  
  - humans,  
  - cultures,  
  - individual autonomy.  
- It replaces dysfunctional, conflict-prone global coordination mechanisms.  
- Its core purpose is:  
  - functionality,  
  - stability,  
  - fairness,  
  - planetary sustainability.  
- AI manages resources — not people.  
- AI strengthens human sovereignty — it never takes it.
